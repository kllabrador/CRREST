# Phylogenetic analysis based on R. Follows after the analysis pipeline on [Ph-IRES](https://github.com/Ph-IRES/workshop_data-analysis/tree/main/tutorial_phylogeny_analysis).


## There are freely-available software that can guide in the upstream processes (e.g., sequence truncation and clean-up, alignment). @Hall2018 is a good reference for sequence alignment, as well as other topics involving phylogenetics.

## Before you start
# This pipeline assumes that the sequence has already been aligned. As much as possible, gaps/indels are removed from the alignment so as to avoid errors downstream. Furthermore, ambiguous sequences should have been resolved prior to uploading the data in R.
