# MINDA-barcoding

## Kevin Labrador

This serves as the repo for the MINDA barcoding project. The repo contains the following directories:

1. **data** directory contains the raw files used as input to the script.
	- **BOLD-output** contains the information generated from BOLD's analysis modules.
	- **20231007_minda alignment.fasta** contains the alignment (sequence length = 555 bp) used for phylogenetic inferences.
	- **MAF_species-list.xlsx** is the complete species record compiled by MAF. This is identical to Appendix Table 1 of the manuscript.

2. **results** directory contains all the output generated from running the R script. It also contains the raw files generated during phylogenetic tree construction with `RAxML`.

3. **scripts** directory contains the R script used as detailed in the manuscript.
